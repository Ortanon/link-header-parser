# link-header-parser
A vanilla ES2015 adaptation of https://www.npmjs.com/package/parse-link-header

## Why?
I'm learning JavaScript and it seemed interesting to perform this exercise. Also I really like the idea of pagination with headers, so having a lightweight parser that can go in the browser without extra steps seemed useful.

## Aside
There was [one issue](https://github.com/thlorenz/parse-link-header/issues/11) in the parse-link-header project, and [a PR](https://github.com/thlorenz/parse-link-header/pull/12) in it, but it was never merged and instead there was this weird argument about whether collaborators should also be able to push to npm (or something). I went ahead and implemented that change too.
